# Hand-Sign-Detection-
Hand Sign Detection  using Tensorflow

The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others. This particular classification problem can be useful for Gesture Navigation, for example. The method Iâ€™ll be using is Deep Learning with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks based on Tensorflow and Keras
